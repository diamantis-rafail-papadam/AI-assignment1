# Technical University of Crete - PLH311 - Assignment 1

This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student.

In the ".zip" file you will find my implementation of 3 shortest path search algorithms under uncertainty.

1) <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/viewFile/4017/4357" target="_blank">Uniform Cost Search</a>
2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*" target="_blank">Iterative Deepening A*</a>
3) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.4076.pdf" target="_blank">Learning Real Time A*</a>

You can compile my program by executing the command "g++ project1.cpp -o project1" from a terminal.
