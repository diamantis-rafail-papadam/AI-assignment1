# Technical University of Crete - PLH311 - Assignment 1

This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student.

In the ".zip" file you will find my implementation of 3 shortest path search algorithms under uncertainty.

1) Uniform Cost Search (https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/viewFile/4017/4357)
2) Iterative Deepening A* Search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*)
3) Learning Real Time A* Search (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.4076.pdf)

You can compile my program by executing "g++ project1.cpp -o project1"
